# === PROCESS MATCHING ===
# At least one of these should be set

# Match by executable name (case-insensitive, without path)

# Match by process comm pattern (advanced)

# === V-CACHE PREFERENCE (AMD X3D only) ===
# - "auto": Let scheduler decide based on workload
# - "cache": Force V-Cache CCD (best for most games)
# - "frequency": Force high-frequency CCD (rare, for specific workloads)

# === SMT PREFERENCE ===
# - "auto": Let scheduler decide
# - "prefer_idle": Prefer CPUs with idle SMT sibling (lower latency)
# - "allow_shared": Allow shared physical cores (higher throughput)

# === SCHEDULING TUNABLES ===

# Burst detection threshold (nanoseconds)
# Lower = more tasks classified as interactive
# Competitive FPS: 1000000 (1ms)
# Action games: 1500000 (1.5ms)
# Default: 2000000 (2ms)

# Time slice duration (nanoseconds)
# Lower = more responsive, higher context switch overhead
