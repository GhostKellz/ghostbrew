# GhostBrew Game Profile - EVE Online Multiboxing (3 Accounts)
#
# Optimized for running multiple EVE Online clients simultaneously.
# Balances load across CCDs to prevent thermal throttling.
#
# Install: cp eve-multibox.toml ~/.config/ghostbrew/profiles/
#
# Tips for multiboxing:
# - Run main account first (gets best cores via prefcore)
# - Use ISBoxer or similar for input broadcasting
# - Consider lowering graphics on alt accounts

# V-Cache preference - EVE benefits heavily from cache
# All 3 clients will compete for V-Cache CCD

# SMT preference - spread load, don't pack cores
# This helps when running 3+ clients

[tunables]
# Slightly higher burst threshold to give each client fair time
# Prevents one client from starving others during fleet fights
burst_threshold_ns = 2000000  # 2ms

# Longer time slice for multiboxing - reduces context switch overhead
# Each client gets more uninterrupted CPU time
slice_ns = 4000000  # 4ms (vs 3ms default)
